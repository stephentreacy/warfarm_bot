# Warfarm Bot

A Discord bot to find the price of prime items in Warframe. Used to get a quick overview of prices and decide if the item should be bought or farmed in game.

User saves their personal https://tenno.zone/planner/ link to a database.

Uses Selenium to get selected items and the [warframe.market](https://warframe.market/) API to get current orders for each item.

Creates an embeded message containing a [warframe.market](https://warframe.market/) link for the item and the most relevant buy and sale orders.
